![Jazz modules](diagrams/jazz_modules.png)

This diagram shows how the different Jazz module fit. Everything except the dotted nodes
is in the repository.\n
\n
A. Is the folder jazz_elemets (all the pieces that work on blocks)\n
B. Is the folder jazz_functional (all the pieces that support higher level abstractions)\n
C. Is the folder jazz_main (for the http server only)\n
\n
You will typically use (5) for extending the backend in C++. (noted as (x))\n
You will typically use (4) for connect to other languages, other than R & Python.\n
You will typically use (3) to run R & Python scripts for both local and remote sources.\n
You will typically use (2) build docker images containing your applications.\n
\n
If you use (1), you are the end user, not a developer. ;-)\n

\section note_sec TRANSITION FROM Jazz 0.1.x

  The working scaffold released as 0.2.1.99 is functionally equivalent (the server) to Jazz 0.1.7.
Jazz will be completely rewritten bottom-up (starting from new block definitions and Jazz classes)
during this rewriting, every time we merge the master branch (adding 0.0.1 to the version) will
be fully functional and tested as a replacement for the 0.1.7 server. When rewiting is done,
all the old files will be removed (the authorship remains as there is a lot of code copying).

At this point, both the R and the Python clients will be fully functional and we change the
version to 0.3.1. The version will be conceptually Jazz, allthough many basic primitives
will still be missing.
