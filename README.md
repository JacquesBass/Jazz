## Jazz

Jazz a lightweight analytical web server for data-driven applications. It provides data persistence and computation capabilities accessible 
through a REST API. It is meant for solutions that need to rely on fast processing, scalable and reliable open source C and C++ libraries.
A Jazz server installs in less than a minute and has a startup time of less than a second. It integrates with R, Python or any API capable software.


## History and Objectives

Jazz started as a research project on fast data processing servers led by Santiago Basaldúa at BBVA Data & Analytics that evolved into an analytical 
web server. In December 2017 the source code of the server and the R client was released under an Apache 2.0 license.
Today, the aim of the project is to pivot the original design into a lightweight server oriented to make deep neural networks available through APIs.


## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Roberto Maestre and Israel Herraiz who have been discussing the idea giving valuable feedback since the beginning, the members of the BBVA Software Engineering Core, especially Manuel Valdés and César de Pablo, for their feedback, the BBVA Data and Open Innovation Platforms team, especially Óscar Tomás and Ángel Puerto, for the hardware and their feedback, Jose Antonio Rodriguez who organized the initial presentation to the UI team, as well as BBVA labs for their feedback and help with the OSS release.


## Next Steps

  - We will soon deliver a Docker image corresponding to Jazz 0.1.7 to simplify "Hands on Jazz" experience.
  - There is a huge refactoring to do for version 0.2.0.
  - This repository is where it will happen. Stay Tuned.
