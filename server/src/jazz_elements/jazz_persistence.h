/**
This is the root class for storing persisted JazzBlocks. JazzBlocks are created with jazz_persistence::JazzPersistence::new_jazz_block()
or (JazzPersistence descendant::)new_jazz_block() and not required to be removed, but can be removed using
(JazzPersistence descendant::)remove_jazz_block(). Unlike volatile JazzBlocks, persisted JazzBlocks are not controlled by a JazzBlockKeeprItem.
Difference between JazzPersistence and JazzSource is the former implements a strict JazzBlockKeepr interface that can be used from c++ to do
things like select information from blocks without assigning or copying them, the latter has a much simpler interface that is exported to
Python and R and provides what a script language programmer would expect at the price of not always benefiting from the memory-mapped
file allocation in lmdb that underlies JazzPersistence.

THREAD SAFETY: All public methods in JazzBlockKeepr descendants must be thread safe. In the core objects, thread-safe failure in public methods
is treated as a top priority bug that is intended to be spotted in burn-in tests. Private methods can be unsafe, but the public methods calling
them must be aware of their limitations and use thread-locking when necessary. (Copy this message in all descendants.)
