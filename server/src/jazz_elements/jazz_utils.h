/**< \brief Miscelaneous utility functions for Jazz.

	This module defines many unrelated functions needed by Jazz. The only rule is: functions, not classes and
without global variables. For example, the logger does not belong here, since it is a configurable object, but
some elements of the logger that are just pure functions are here.
