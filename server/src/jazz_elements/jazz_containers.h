/**< \brief Container classes for JazzBlock objects.

  JazzBlock objects can be:\n

1. One-shot - Owned by the caller of new_jazz_block()\n
2. Volatile - Owned by some JazzBlockKeepr descendant that is not a JazzPersistence (or descendant)\n
3. Persisted - Owned by a JazzPersistence (or descendant), typically a JazzSource


Unlike
in Jazz 0.1.+, there is no support for embedded R (or any other interpreters).
